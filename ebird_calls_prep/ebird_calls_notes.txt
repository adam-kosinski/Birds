Disable flag poor quality (I did this already, and we want to avoid ebird ids getting into firebase)
- I also put a check in the firebase code for this

Don't filter for short audio for ebird ones?

Add bird autocomplete should be limited to birds we have data for

Revert mode to only being visual_id or birdsong, and add a new URL parameter
This makes more sense for CSS and game logic
