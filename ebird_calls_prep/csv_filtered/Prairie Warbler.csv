I was checking a bee research block when I heard what I thought was a some type of warbler. Upon further investigation, I spotted a warbler with a bright yellow throat, breast, and belly. I then heard the song and was able to resolve that it was a prairie warbler. There was a PRAW found hear last june so this is not unheard of at this location. My original intent for this visit was not necessarily birding but I first heard what appeared to be a Prairie Warbler. I continued on to do the task that I had originally came to do. After I was done, I got my recording equipment out in the case that I heard this again. I walked to the location that I had originally heard it and waited for about an hour. I walked around for another hour and a half and finally heard the tell tale pitch of this warbler. I managed to attain a recording of it and afforded a few good looks. For those that may go to look for this, please respect this fragile ecosystem. Please do not cause any erosion on the slopes. Respect the land being that it is a Scientific and Natural Area. Please leave plants, animals, rocks, and other natural elements in place to fulfill their life cycle and role in the environment.
