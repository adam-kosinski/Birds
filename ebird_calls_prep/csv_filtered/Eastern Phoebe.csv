The recording contains three definite bill clicks: at the 0.5, 0.7, and 1.3 second marks. (I think the vertical line at the 0.2 second mark is just recording noise.) The bird was within 10 feet of me for most of the recording, and thereafter I left the area to avoid distressing them any more.","Having noticed this morning that the nest at the house was empty, I was not surprised to encounter a couple of the recently fledged young with short tails in the brush along the power line. However, one of the parents noticed me, decided it was unhappy with me being there, and flew at me making an alarm call and a clicking noise that I've never heard from a phoebe. It flew at me from the direction of the young, and the clicking occurred only during the flight; later it sat in trees in the opposite direction of the young, very effectively drawing my attention away from them. I made a quick recording then backed off to give them space. Online research indicates that the clicking is a bill snap.
 
 Eric also saw one of the members of this phoebe pair act very defensive; a week or two ago, he saw it dive bomb a wren (memory says House Wren) that had popped up from the azaleas west of the house onto the retaining wall below the phoebe nest.",Sayornis phoebe,easpho,Species,16840,,4.00,4,,,
