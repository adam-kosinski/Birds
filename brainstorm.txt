Audio filtering
- popular observations are all very good (from a brief test)
- observation comment might mean something had to be clarified?
    - this doesn't seem to be true in general
- observations with more identifications are easier?
- observations without photos - rely only upon sound
- audio clips that aren't that long - less chance of a ton of silence before hearing the bird


Some birds might not have any observations - especially if filters are restrictive
- check for this somehow?
- doing a test with backyard birds, popular observations only:
    - rock pigeon: 0
    - white breasted nuthatch: 3
    - cedar waxwing: 4
    - mourning dove, tufted titmouse, downy woodpecker: 8
    - yellow warbler: 12
    - rest were 16+


Customization
- setting to not include the "other" red herrings
- setting to load sounds distributed how they are in nature, not evenly among taxa




Design goals

Practice identifying bird species based on their calls
- select bird species to practice
- have nonselected species show up too

Practice identifying birds based on appearance
- at the order, family, genus, species levels

Don't rely on downloaded csv for observations (more flexible)



Common name issue
- We can build a database of order and family common names, but there are too many genera/species
- We use common names for selecting what to practice, autocompleting the guess input, and displaying results
- Can dynamically query common names before images are presented



Wildflower incompatibilities:
- family common names come from family csv
- observations are organized by family
