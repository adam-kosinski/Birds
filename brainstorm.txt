TODO

Remove clear list button - never used
Instead, always show recommend and clear selection ("DESELECT ALL")
Show selection checkboxes, by default all are selected - if user wants to practice 4, they can deselect all and then tap those to practice
Disable start button if none are selected

Consider adjusting N_OBS_PER_TAXON based on number of taxa (fewer taxa = larger threshold b/c more likely to repeat)

Other filtering? Though current sounds are fairly good I think
- do some experimentation listening to with photos vs without photos, and number of identifications
- and evaluate more rigorously the idea that popular recordings are better

Audio filtering
- popular observations are all very good (from a brief test)
- observation comment might mean something had to be clarified?
    - this doesn't seem to be true in general
- observations with more identifications are easier?
- observations without photos - rely only upon sound
- audio clips that aren't that long - less chance of a ton of silence before hearing the bird


Customization
- setting to not include the "other" red herrings
- setting to load sounds distributed how they are in nature, not evenly among taxa




Design goals

Practice identifying bird species based on their calls
- select bird species to practice
- have nonselected species show up too

Practice identifying birds based on appearance
- at the order, family, genus, species levels

Don't rely on downloaded csv for observations (more flexible)
