Prioritize finding an observation for those who have nothing
Prioritize finding observations for those who have below threshold

Fetch for all from popular (maybe several times?)
Fetch birds not meeting threshold, from popular
At somepoint (before exhausting popular perhaps), start fetching from non-popular


TODO fix sidescrolling on bird grid



Audio filtering
- popular observations are all very good (from a brief test)
- observation comment might mean something had to be clarified?
    - this doesn't seem to be true in general
- observations with more identifications are easier?
- observations without photos - rely only upon sound
- audio clips that aren't that long - less chance of a ton of silence before hearing the bird


Some birds might not have any observations - especially if filters are restrictive
- check for this somehow?
- doing a test with backyard birds, popular observations only:
    - rock pigeon: 0
    - white breasted nuthatch: 3
    - cedar waxwing: 4
    - mourning dove, tufted titmouse, downy woodpecker: 8
    - yellow warbler: 12
    - rest were 16+


Customization
- setting to not include the "other" red herrings
- setting to load sounds distributed how they are in nature, not evenly among taxa




Design goals

Practice identifying bird species based on their calls
- select bird species to practice
- have nonselected species show up too

Practice identifying birds based on appearance
- at the order, family, genus, species levels

Don't rely on downloaded csv for observations (more flexible)



Common name issue
- We can build a database of order and family common names, but there are too many genera/species
- We use common names for selecting what to practice, autocompleting the guess input, and displaying results
- Can dynamically query common names before images are presented



Wildflower incompatibilities:
- family common names come from family csv
- observations are organized by family
