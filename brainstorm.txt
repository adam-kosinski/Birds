Customization
- setting to not include the "other" red herrings
- setting to load sounds distributed how they are in nature, not evenly among taxa




Design goals

Practice identifying bird species based on their calls
- select bird species to practice
- have nonselected species show up too

Practice identifying birds based on appearance
- at the order, family, genus, species levels

Don't rely on downloaded csv for observations (more flexible)



Common name issue
- We can build a database of order and family common names, but there are too many genera/species
- We use common names for selecting what to practice, autocompleting the guess input, and displaying results
- Can dynamically query common names before images are presented



Wildflower incompatibilities:
- family common names come from family csv
- observations are organized by family
